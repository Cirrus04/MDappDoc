### What is Stop-Loss?

A **stop-loss** is a fundamental risk management strategy in stock trading. A stop-loss order is an instruction to automatically sell a stock when its price falls to a predetermined level, thereby limiting the potential loss on the position.

In short, it works like this:

- You set a stop-loss level, which is a price at which your stock will be automatically sold if the price falls to or below that level.
    - The purpose is to protect your capital by avoiding significant losses.
    - The advantage of using a stop-loss is that you do not need to constantly monitor the market and can have a predefined exit plan.

### Types of Stop-Loss Orders

#### Fixed Stop-Loss

This is a static price level that does not change unless you manually move it.

**Example of a Fixed Stop-Loss**

You buy 100 shares of Company X at $100 per share.<br>
To protect yourself from excessive losses, you place a stop-loss order at $90.

- If the stock rises to $110 → **Nothing happens**, as the stop-loss is only triggered by a falling price.
- If the stock falls to $90 → Your **stop-loss order is triggered**, and your shares are automatically sold.
- If the stock continues to fall to $80 → You have already sold at $90, avoiding a larger loss.

#### Trailing Stop-Loss

This is a dynamic stop-loss that adjusts **upwards** as the stock price rises, but **never moves down**.

**Example of a Trailing Stop-Loss**

Assume you set a trailing stop-loss of 10%.

If your entry price is $100, the stop-loss is initially activated at $90.

- If the stock rises to $120 → The **stop-loss automatically moves up to $108** (10% below $120).
- The stock continues to rise to $130 → The **stop-loss is adjusted to $117**.
- If the stock then falls to $117 → The **stock is automatically sold**.

**Advantage:** It allows you to ride winning trades and lock in profits, while still providing protection if the trend reverses.

### When Should You Use a Stop-Loss?

> ✅ **Short-Term Trading (Swing Trading, Day Trading)**
>> To quickly limit losses on fast-moving trades.

> ✅ **High-Volatility Stocks**
>> To protect against sudden and sharp price drops.

> ✅ **Long-Term Investments**
>> Can be used to protect unrealized gains in a rising trend (**a trailing stop-loss** is often preferred).

### Risks & Disadvantages

> ⚠️ **Whipsaws**
>> A stock can drop quickly, trigger your stop-loss, and then immediately rebound. This can cause you to sell at a low point unnecessarily.

> ⚠️ **Market Gaps**
>> If a stock opens for trading significantly below your stop-loss price (e.g., due to overnight news), your shares will be sold at the first available market price, which could be much lower than your intended stop-loss level.

> ⚠️ **Triggered by Normal Volatility**
>> If the stop-loss level is set too tightly, it can be triggered by the stock's normal daily price fluctuations, causing you to exit a good position prematurely.

### Summary

- A stop-loss order automatically sells your shares if the price falls to a specific level.
- A trailing stop-loss follows the stock price up, allowing you to lock in profits.
- **Pro**: Limits losses and helps you maintain a disciplined trading strategy.
- **Con**: Can be triggered by temporary price swings or market gaps.

### How to Set a Stop-Loss Level

To determine an appropriate stop-loss level, you can use various methods depending on your trading strategy.

Here are some common approaches:

#### Fixed Percentage Stop-Loss

You set a fixed percentage limit, such as 5% or 10%, below your purchase price.

Example

- You buy a stock for $100.
- You set a 10% stop-loss → The stop-loss is placed at $90.
- If the stock falls to $90 → The stock is automatically sold.

**🔹 Suitable for: Beginners, swing trading, stocks with low volatility.**

#### ATR (Average True Range) – Volatility-Based Stop-Loss

ATR measures how much a stock moves on average per day. This method adapts your stop-loss to the stock's specific volatility.

You can set the stop-loss at, for example, 1.5x or 2x the ATR below the price to avoid being stopped out by normal market noise.

Example Calculation

- The stock has an Average True Range (ATR) of $3/day.
- You set the stop-loss at 2 x ATR → The stop-loss becomes $6 below your entry price.
- Purchase Price: $100 → Stop-Loss: $94.

**🔹 Suitable for: Day trading, swing trading, volatile stocks.**

#### Technical Analysis – Support/Resistance Stop-Loss

You place your stop-loss just below a key technical level, such as a support line or a previous swing low on the chart.

Example

- The stock has previously bounced off the $95 level several times (a support level).
- You buy at $100 and set your stop-loss at $94 (just below the support).

**🔹 Suitable for: Technical traders, long-term investors who use chart patterns.**

#### Break-even Stop-Loss (Risk-Free Trade)

Once the stock has risen by a certain amount, you move your stop-loss up to your entry price, ensuring you cannot lose money on the trade.

Example

- You buy a stock for $100 (initial stop-loss at $90).
- When the stock reaches $110, you move your stop-loss from $90 up to $100.
- If the stock falls back → You sell at 100 for a break−even trade(0 profit/loss).

**🔹 Suitable for: Traders who want to minimize risk quickly.**

#### Trailing Stop-Loss – Locking in Profits

A trailing stop-loss follows the stock's gains, allowing you to capture a large part of the trend while protecting profits.

Example

- You set a 10% trailing stop-loss.
- The stock is purchased at $100 → The stop-loss starts at $90.
- The stock rises to $120 → The stop-loss moves up to $108.
- If the stock falls to $108 → The stock is automatically sold, locking in an $8 profit.

**🔹 Suitable for: Long-term investors, trend-following strategies.**

### Which Method Suits You?
> ✅ **Short-Term (Day/Swing Trading)** → ATR-based or Percentage stop-loss.

> ✅ **Long-Term (Investing)** → Support-based or Trailing stop-loss.

> ✅ **Unsure about Volatility?** → ATR provides a more dynamic and adaptive stop-loss.
