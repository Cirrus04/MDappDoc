### What is MACD?</span>__

MACD (*Moving Average Convergence Divergence* ) is a trend-following momentum indicator.
It shows the relationship between two Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) of a security's price.

The indicator is displayed as 3 main components, shown in a separate chart below the price chart:

- __MACD Line__: The primary line.
It's calculated by subtracting a longer-term EMA (typically 26 periods) from a shorter-term EMA (typically 12 periods). It indicates the short-term momentum relative to the long-term.

- __Signal Line__: This is a 9-period EMA of the MACD line.
Because it's an average of the MACD line, it moves slower and acts as a trigger or "signal" for trading decisions.

- __MACD Histogram__: The bars on the chart. They represent the difference between the MACD line and the Signal Line.
    When the histogram is above the zero line, the MACD line is above the Signal Line (___bullish/positive momentum ___).
    When the histogram is below the zero line, the MACD line is below the Signal Line (___bearish/negative momentum ___).

### How is MACD Used?</span>__

MACD is used to identify the trend's direction, momentum, and potential turning points.

Here are the most common signals:

- __Crossovers__: This is the most basic signal from the MACD.

    - __Bullish Crossover (Buy Signal)__: When the MACD line crosses above the Signal Line, it suggests that short-term momentum is gaining strength relative to the longer-term. This is often seen as a buy signal or confirmation of an emerging uptrend. The histogram moves from negative to positive.

    - __Bearish Crossover (Sell Signal)__: When the MACD line crosses below the Signal Line, it suggests that short-term momentum is weakening. This is often seen as a sell signal or a warning of a potential downtrend. The histogram moves from positive to negative.

    __Example__: In the MACD chart for a stock, when the blue (MACD) line crosses above the orange (Signal) line, the price often tends to rise shortly thereafter.

- __Centerline Crossovers__:
    - __Bullish Centerline Crossover__: When the MACD line (the faster line) moves above the zero line, it indicates that the shorter-term moving average (EMA 12) has crossed above the longer-term moving average (EMA 26). This is a stronger confirmation of an uptrend.

    - __Bearish Centerline Crossover__: When the MACD line moves below the zero line, it indicates a confirmed downtrend.

- __Divergences__: This is a more advanced, but very powerful signal that can warn of an upcoming trend reversal.

    - __Bullish Divergence__: The price in the price chart makes a new lower low, but the MACD indicator makes a higher low. This suggests that selling pressure is weakening and the trend might reverse to the upside.

    - __Bearish Divergence__: The price in the price chart makes a new higher high, but the MACD indicator makes a lower high. This suggests that buying pressure is weakening and the trend might reverse to the downside.

    __Example__: If the stock price is rising to a new high, but the MACD peak is lower than a previous peak, it is a warning signal, showing that the strength behind the rise is diminishing and a correction could be near.

### Summary of Signals</span>__

| Signal   |      Indication      |  Use |
|----------|-------------|------|
| Bullish Crossover | MACD > Signal | Potential buy signal, start of an uptrend |
| Bearish Crossover | MACD < Signal | Sell signal, start of a downtrend |
| Bullish Divergence | Price makes lower low, MACD makes higher low | Warning that a downtrend may be about to reverse |
| Bearish Divergence | Price makes higher high, MACD makes lower high | Warning that an uptrend may be about to reverse |

### Important Notes</span>__

- MACD is a lagging indicator, meaning it reacts to price movements that have already occurred.<br>
- MACD works best in trending markets.<br>
- It can give false signals in sideways or highly volatile markets.<br>
- Always combine MACD with other forms of analysis (trend lines, support/resistance levels, other indicators).<br>
