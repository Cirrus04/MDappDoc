### What is RSI?</span>__
The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a __momentum oscillator__ that measures the speed and change of price movements. It oscillates on a scale of 0 to 100 and is used to identify potentially overbought or oversold conditions in a market.

### How is it used?</span>__
- __Overbought & Oversold Levels__:
    - __Overbought (RSI > 70)__: Suggests that a security has been rising strongly and may be due for a pause or a corrective pullback. It is a warning, not an automatic sell signal, as strong trends can remain overbought for long periods.
    - __Oversold (RSI < 30)__: Suggests that a security has been falling sharply and may be due for a bounce or relief rally.
- __Divergences (A Powerful Signal)__:
    - __Bearish Divergence__: The price makes a new high, but the RSI makes a lower high. This indicates that the upward momentum is weakening and a reversal may be coming.
    - __Bullish Divergence__: The price makes a new low, but the RSI makes a higher low. This indicates that the downward momentum is fading and a reversal to the upside may be near.
- __Centerline (50-Level)__: The 50-level is often seen as the dividing line for momentum. An RSI above 50 suggests bullish momentum, while an RSI below 50 suggests bearish momentum.
