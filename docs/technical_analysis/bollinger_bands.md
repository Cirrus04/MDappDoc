### What are Bollinger Bands?</span>__

Bollinger Bands are a __volatility indicator__.

They consist of three lines drawn in relation to a security's price:

- __Middle Band__: A Simple Moving Average (SMA), typically with a 20-period setting.
- __Upper Band__: The Middle Band + 2 standard deviations.
- __Lower Band__: The Middle Band - 2 standard deviations.

The bands automatically widen when volatility increases and narrow when volatility decreases.

### How are they used?</span>__
- __Defining "High" and "Low"__: The bands provide a relative definition of high and low prices. Prices are considered high when they are near the upper band and low when they are near the lower band.
- __Volatility Squeeze__: When the bands narrow significantly (a "squeeze"), it indicates a period of low volatility. This is often followed by a period of high volatility, signaling that a significant price move (a "breakout") could be imminent in either direction.
- __Overbought/Oversold Signals (in Ranging Markets)__: In a sideways market, prices touching the upper band can be seen as a potential sell signal, and prices touching the lower band can be a potential buy signal, with the expectation that the price will revert toward the middle band. __This strategy is unreliable in strong trends__.
- __Trend Confirmation ("Walking the Bands")__: In a strong uptrend, prices will often "walk" along the upper band, consistently touching or even exceeding it. This is a sign of trend strength, not a sell signal. The opposite is true for a strong downtrend along the lower band.
