### What is ADX?</span>__
The ADX is a __trend strength indicator__.<br>
Its sole purpose is to measure the __strength or intensity of a trend__, not its direction.

The ADX line is plotted on a scale of 0 to 100. It is accompanied by two other lines:

- __+DI (Positive Directional Indicator)__: Measures the strength of upward price movement.
- __-DI (Negative Directional Indicator)__: Measures the strength of downward price movement.

### How is it used?</span>__
- __Measuring Trend Strength (The ADX Line)__:
    - __ADX rising__: The trend is getting stronger (whether it's an up or down trend).
    - __ADX falling__: The trend is getting weaker, and the market may be entering a sideways or range-bound period.
    - __ADX < 25__: Generally indicates a weak trend or a non-trending market. Trend-following strategies may be less effective.
    - __ADX > 25__: Suggests the presence of a trend that is strong enough to trade.
- __Determining Trend Direction (The DI Lines)__:
    - __Uptrend__: The +DI line is above the -DI line.
    - __Downtrend__: The -DI line is above the +DI line.
    - __DI Crossovers__: A crossover of the +DI and -DI lines can signal a potential change in trend direction. However, this signal is only considered reliable if the ADX line is also rising and above ~25, confirming that there is actual strength behind the new direction.

### Key Takeaway</span>__
Use ADX to first determine if a strong trend exists. If ADX is high, then use the DI lines to determine the direction of that trend.
